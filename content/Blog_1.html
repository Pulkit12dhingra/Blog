    <h2 class="fw-bold mb-3">Hello World! 🚀 — My First Blog Post</h2>

    <p>
      Let's start with something familiar:
    </p>
  
    <pre class="bg-light p-3 rounded">
  <code>print("Hello, World!")</code>
    </pre>
  
    <p>
      If you've ever written your first line of code, you probably recognize the line above. It's the traditional starting point — the digital equivalent of introducing yourself to the terminal and saying, “Hey, I'm here!” 🙋‍♂️
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Today, I’m doing the same — not in a terminal, but right here in this blog. After many lines of HTML, CSS, JavaScript (and yes, plenty of coffee ☕), this blog is finally live!
    </p>
  
    <p>
      This space is my corner of the internet where I’ll share thoughts, projects, bugs, breakthroughs, and brain dumps — especially around <strong>coding, software development, AI, and data science</strong>. Whether it’s diving into a tutorial or reflecting on a weird bug I fought for hours, it’ll all live here.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      So to anyone reading: welcome! 🎉 Whether you're new to code or a seasoned dev, I hope this blog brings something useful, fun, or just relatable.
    </p>

      Just like every program starts with a “Hello, World!”, every journey begins with a first step.
      This is mine — and I can’t wait to see where it goes. 🙌
