  <h4 class="mt-4">What is Git and GitHub?</h4>
  
  <h5 class="mt-3">Git: The Version Control System</h5>
  <p>
    <strong>Git</strong> is a distributed version control system (VCS) that tracks changes in your code over time. Think of it as a time machine for your projects — you can save snapshots of your work, experiment without fear, and collaborate seamlessly with others.
  </p>
  
  <p><strong>Why Git matters:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Track changes:</strong> See what changed, when, and by whom</li>
    <li><strong>Collaborate safely:</strong> Multiple people can work on the same project without conflicts</li>
    <li><strong>Experiment freely:</strong> Create branches to test new features without breaking your main code</li>
    <li><strong>Backup automatically:</strong> Your entire project history is distributed across all contributors</li>
    <li><strong>Undo mistakes:</strong> Roll back to any previous state with a single command</li>
  </ul>

  <h5 class="mt-3">GitHub: Git Hosting + Social Coding</h5>
  <p>
    <strong>GitHub</strong> is a cloud-based platform that hosts Git repositories and adds powerful collaboration features. It's like Git plus a social network for developers.
  </p>
  
  <p><strong>GitHub provides:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Remote hosting:</strong> Store your repositories in the cloud</li>
    <li><strong>Collaboration tools:</strong> Pull requests, code reviews, issues, and project boards</li>
    <li><strong>CI/CD:</strong> GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment</li>
    <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> README files, wikis, and GitHub Pages for static sites</li>
    <li><strong>Community:</strong> Discover, fork, and contribute to millions of open source projects</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="alert alert-warning mt-3" role="alert">
    <strong>Key Difference:</strong> Git is the tool, GitHub is the platform. You use Git locally on your machine, and GitHub as a remote hub for collaboration.
  </div>

  <h4 class="mt-5">Understanding Branches, Commits, and Pull Requests</h4>

  <h5 class="mt-3">Commits: Saving Snapshots</h5>
  <p>
    A <strong>commit</strong> is like a checkpoint in a video game — it saves the current state of your project with a message describing what changed. Think of it as taking a snapshot of your entire project at a specific moment in time.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>What happens when you commit?</strong>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Git creates a unique ID (SHA hash):</strong> Every commit gets a 40-character identifier (e.g., <code>a3f2b1c...</code>)</li>
    <li><strong>Stores metadata:</strong> Author name, email, timestamp, and commit message</li>
    <li><strong>Records changes:</strong> Git saves what changed (diffs), not the entire file again</li>
    <li><strong>Creates a timeline:</strong> Each commit points to its parent, forming a chain of history</li>
    <li><strong>Becomes permanent:</strong> Once committed, you can always go back to this exact state</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    <strong>The anatomy of a commit:</strong> Each commit contains three key pieces of information:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>What changed:</strong> The actual code modifications (diff)</li>
    <li><strong>When and by whom:</strong> Timestamp and author information</li>
    <li><strong>Why it changed:</strong> Your commit message explaining the purpose</li>
  </ol>

  <div class="alert alert-info mt-3" role="alert">
    <strong>Think of commits as save points:</strong> You can travel back to any commit to see what your project looked like at that moment, or even restore your project to that state if needed.
  </div>

  <pre class="bg-light p-3 rounded"><code># Make changes to your files
git add file1.py file2.py       # Stage specific files
git add .                        # Stage all changes

# Create a commit with a descriptive message
git commit -m "Add user authentication feature"

# View commit history
git log
git log --oneline --graph        # Compact, visual format</code></pre>

  <p><strong>Good commit practices:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Write clear, descriptive messages (not "fix bug" but "Fix login validation for empty passwords")</li>
    <li>Make small, focused commits (one feature/fix per commit)</li>
    <li>Commit often to create a detailed history</li>
    <li>Use present tense: "Add feature" not "Added feature"</li>
  </ul>

  <h5 class="mt-4">Branches: Parallel Development</h5>
  <p>
    <strong>Branches</strong> are one of Git's most powerful features. They let you diverge from the main codebase to work on features, fixes, or experiments without affecting the stable version. Imagine branches as parallel universes where you can make changes safely.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Why branches are essential:</strong>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Isolated development:</strong> Work on new features without breaking the main codebase</li>
    <li><strong>Experimentation:</strong> Try risky changes without fear — if it fails, just delete the branch</li>
    <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> Multiple developers can work on different features simultaneously</li>
    <li><strong>Code review:</strong> Changes can be reviewed before merging into the main branch</li>
    <li><strong>Version management:</strong> Maintain different versions (production, staging, development) as separate branches</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    <strong>How branches work:</strong> When you create a branch, Git creates a pointer to the current commit. As you make new commits on that branch, the pointer moves forward, but the main branch stays where it was. Later, you can merge these changes back into main.
  </p>

  <div class="alert alert-success mt-3" role="alert">
    <strong>Branch visualization:</strong> Imagine a tree — the trunk is your main branch, and each branch is a limb growing in its own direction. Eventually, branches can merge back into the trunk.
  </div>

  <p>
    <strong>Branch lifecycle:</strong>
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Create:</strong> Start a new branch from an existing commit (usually from <code>main</code>)</li>
    <li><strong>Develop:</strong> Make commits on your branch as you build your feature</li>
    <li><strong>Push:</strong> Share your branch with others by pushing to remote</li>
    <li><strong>Review:</strong> Open a pull request for team review</li>
    <li><strong>Merge:</strong> Combine your changes back into the main branch</li>
    <li><strong>Delete:</strong> Clean up the branch once it's merged</li>
  </ol>

  <pre class="bg-light p-3 rounded"><code># Create a new branch
git branch feature/user-profile

# Switch to that branch
git checkout feature/user-profile

# Or do both in one command
git checkout -b feature/user-profile

# List all branches
git branch                       # Local branches
git branch -r                    # Remote branches
git branch -a                    # All branches

# Switch back to main
git checkout main

# Delete a branch
git branch -d feature/user-profile</code></pre>

  <p><strong>Common branch naming conventions:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>main</code> or <code>master</code>: The production-ready code</li>
    <li><code>develop</code>: Integration branch for features</li>
    <li><code>feature/feature-name</code>: New features</li>
    <li><code>bugfix/bug-description</code>: Bug fixes</li>
    <li><code>hotfix/critical-issue</code>: Urgent production fixes</li>
  </ul>

  <h5 class="mt-4">Pull Requests (PRs): Code Review & Merging</h5>
  <p>
    A <strong>pull request</strong> (PR) is GitHub's mechanism for proposing, reviewing, and discussing code changes before they're merged into the main codebase. Despite the name, you're not "pulling" anything — you're asking maintainers to "pull" your changes into their repository.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Why pull requests matter:</strong>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Code quality:</strong> Get feedback from experienced developers before code goes live</li>
    <li><strong>Knowledge sharing:</strong> Team members learn from reviewing each other's code</li>
    <li><strong>Bug prevention:</strong> Multiple eyes catch issues you might have missed</li>
    <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> PR discussions create a record of why decisions were made</li>
    <li><strong>Automated checks:</strong> CI/CD runs tests automatically on every PR</li>
    <li><strong>Safe merging:</strong> Ensures only reviewed, tested code enters production</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    <strong>Anatomy of a pull request:</strong>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Title:</strong> Clear, concise summary (e.g., "Add user authentication with JWT")</li>
    <li><strong>Description:</strong> Detailed explanation of what changed and why</li>
    <li><strong>Changes tab:</strong> Shows the actual code diff (what was added/removed)</li>
    <li><strong>Commits tab:</strong> Lists all commits included in this PR</li>
    <li><strong>Checks:</strong> Status of automated tests and builds</li>
    <li><strong>Reviewers:</strong> People assigned to review your code</li>
    <li><strong>Comments:</strong> Discussion thread for feedback and questions</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="alert alert-warning mt-3" role="alert">
    <strong>The PR workflow cycle:</strong> PR created → Automated tests run → Reviewers comment → Author fixes issues → Tests run again → Reviewers approve → PR merged → Branch deleted.
  </div>

  <p>
    <strong>Best practices for pull requests:</strong>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Keep them small:</strong> Smaller PRs are easier to review (aim for <400 lines changed)</li>
    <li><strong>One purpose per PR:</strong> Don't mix feature work with unrelated refactoring</li>
    <li><strong>Write good descriptions:</strong> Explain the "why" not just the "what"</li>
    <li><strong>Link issues:</strong> Reference related issues with <code>Fixes #123</code> or <code>Closes #456</code></li>
    <li><strong>Add screenshots:</strong> Visual changes should include before/after images</li>
    <li><strong>Respond promptly:</strong> Address reviewer feedback quickly to keep momentum</li>
    <li><strong>Be respectful:</strong> Reviews are about code quality, not personal criticism</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Pull request workflow:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>Create a branch and make changes</li>
    <li>Push your branch to GitHub</li>
    <li>Open a PR on GitHub's web interface</li>
    <li>Team members review your code, leave comments</li>
    <li>You address feedback and push more commits</li>
    <li>Once approved, the PR is merged</li>
  </ol>

  <pre class="bg-light p-3 rounded"><code># After making commits on your branch
git push origin feature/user-profile

# Then on GitHub:
# 1. Go to your repository
# 2. Click "Pull requests" → "New pull request"
# 3. Select your branch
# 4. Add title and description
# 5. Request reviewers
# 6. Click "Create pull request"</code></pre>

  <h4 class="mt-5">The Staging Area and Git CLI</h4>

  <h5 class="mt-3">The Three-State Architecture</h5>
  <p>
    Understanding Git's three-state architecture is crucial to mastering version control. Git operates differently from older systems like SVN — it has an intermediate step between editing files and committing them. This is the <strong>staging area</strong> (also called the "index").
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>The three states explained:</strong>
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Working Directory (Modified):</strong> 
      <ul>
        <li>This is where you actively edit your files</li>
        <li>Changes here are not tracked yet — they only exist on your local filesystem</li>
        <li>If you delete a file here without staging/committing, it's gone forever</li>
        <li>Think of this as your "draft" workspace</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Staging Area / Index (Staged):</strong> 
      <ul>
        <li>An intermediate area where you prepare your next commit</li>
        <li>You selectively choose which changes to include in the next commit</li>
        <li>Allows you to commit only part of your changes (e.g., commit bugfix but not unfinished feature)</li>
        <li>Think of this as a "shopping cart" where you collect changes before checking out</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Repository / .git directory (Committed):</strong> 
      <ul>
        <li>Permanent storage of your project's history</li>
        <li>Once committed, your changes are safe and recoverable</li>
        <li>Each commit is identified by a unique SHA hash</li>
        <li>Think of this as your "published" or "saved" history</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <div class="alert alert-info mt-3" role="alert">
    <strong>Why staging matters:</strong> The staging area gives you fine-grained control. You can work on multiple features simultaneously, but commit them separately with clear, focused commit messages. This keeps your history clean and makes it easier to review or revert specific changes later.
  </div>

  <p>
    <strong>File state transitions:</strong>
  </p>
  <pre class="text-muted"><code>Working Directory  →  Staging Area  →  Repository
   (modified)      git add     (staged)   git commit  (committed)
                              ←  git reset
                   git checkout --  ←</code></pre>

  <pre class="bg-light p-3 rounded"><code># Check status of files
git status

# Output shows:
# - Untracked files (never added to Git)
# - Modified files (changed since last commit)
# - Staged files (ready to be committed)</code></pre>

  <h5 class="mt-4">Staging Area Commands</h5>
  <p>
    The staging area is where you build your next commit piece by piece. These commands help you control exactly what goes into each commit, giving you the flexibility to create clean, logical commits even when you've made many changes.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Common staging scenarios:</strong>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Selective staging:</strong> You fixed two bugs but want separate commits for clarity</li>
    <li><strong>Partial commits:</strong> You're working on a feature but want to commit a quick documentation fix first</li>
    <li><strong>Review before commit:</strong> Stage files, review the diff, then commit only if satisfied</li>
    <li><strong>Unstaging mistakes:</strong> You accidentally staged a file with sensitive data</li>
  </ul>

  <pre class="bg-light p-3 rounded"><code># Add specific files to staging
git add file1.py file2.py

# Add all changes
git add .

# Add all Python files
git add *.py

# Unstage a file (keep changes in working directory)
git reset file1.py

# Unstage all files
git reset

# Discard changes in working directory (careful!)
git checkout -- file1.py

# See what you're about to commit
git diff --staged</code></pre>

  <h5 class="mt-4">Essential Git CLI Commands</h5>
  
  <p>
    The Git command-line interface (CLI) is powerful and versatile. While GUI tools exist, understanding the CLI gives you complete control and helps you troubleshoot issues. Here's a comprehensive guide to the most important commands, organized by task.
  </p>

  <div class="alert alert-success mt-3" role="alert">
    <strong>Pro tip:</strong> Don't try to memorize everything at once! Start with the basics (<code>status</code>, <code>add</code>, <code>commit</code>, <code>push</code>, <code>pull</code>) and gradually expand your toolkit as you encounter new scenarios.
  </div>

  <p><strong>Setup & Configuration:</strong></p>
  <p>These commands configure Git on your machine. You typically run them once after installing Git:</p>
  <pre class="bg-light p-3 rounded"><code># Configure your identity
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"

# Set default branch name
git config --global init.defaultBranch main

# View all settings
git config --list</code></pre>

  <p><strong>Repository Management:</strong></p>
  <p>These commands help you start new projects or connect to existing ones:</p>
  <pre class="bg-light p-3 rounded"><code># Initialize a new repository
git init

# Clone an existing repository
git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git

# Add a remote repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repo.git

# View remotes
git remote -v

# Change remote URL
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/username/new-repo.git</code></pre>

  <p><strong>Working with Changes:</strong></p>
  <pre class="bg-light p-3 rounded"><code># See what changed
git status                       # Summary of changes
git diff                         # Detailed changes (unstaged)
git diff --staged                # Changes in staging area
git diff branch1..branch2        # Compare branches

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Message"          # Commit staged files
git commit -am "Message"         # Stage and commit tracked files
git commit --amend               # Modify last commit

# View history
git log                          # Full commit history
git log --oneline                # Compact view
git log --graph --all            # Visual branch history
git log -p                       # Show diffs in each commit
git log --author="Name"          # Filter by author</code></pre>

  <p><strong>Syncing with Remote:</strong></p>
  <p>These commands synchronize your local repository with GitHub (or other remote hosts). Understanding the difference between <code>fetch</code>, <code>pull</code>, and <code>push</code> is crucial:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>fetch:</strong> Downloads changes from remote but doesn't modify your working files (safe to run anytime)</li>
    <li><strong>pull:</strong> Downloads changes AND merges them into your current branch (fetch + merge)</li>
    <li><strong>push:</strong> Uploads your local commits to the remote repository</li>
  </ul>
  <pre class="bg-light p-3 rounded"><code># Fetch changes from remote (doesn't merge)
git fetch origin

# Pull changes (fetch + merge)
git pull origin main

# Push your changes
git push origin main
git push origin feature/my-branch

# Push and set upstream
git push -u origin main          # First push

# Force push (use with caution!)
git push --force origin main</code></pre>

  <p><strong>Undoing Changes:</strong></p>
  <pre class="bg-light p-3 rounded"><code># Undo last commit (keep changes)
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Undo last commit (discard changes)
git reset --hard HEAD~1

# Revert a commit (creates new commit)
git revert abc123

# Discard all local changes
git reset --hard HEAD

# Remove untracked files
git clean -fd</code></pre>

  <h4 class="mt-5">Common Git Workflows</h4>

  <p>
    Now that you understand the individual commands, let's see how they come together in real-world workflows. These patterns represent how professional developers actually use Git day-to-day.
  </p>

  <h5 class="mt-3">Basic Feature Development Flow</h5>
  <p>
    This is the most common workflow you'll use as a developer. It follows the pattern: sync with main → create branch → develop → push → open PR → merge → clean up. This keeps your work isolated until it's ready to merge.
  </p>
  <pre class="bg-light p-3 rounded"><code># 1. Update main branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# 2. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/new-feature

# 3. Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "Implement new feature"

# 4. Push to remote
git push origin feature/new-feature

# 5. Open PR on GitHub
# 6. After approval, merge via GitHub UI
# 7. Clean up
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git branch -d feature/new-feature</code></pre>

  <h5 class="mt-4">Syncing Fork with Original Repository</h5>
  <p>
    When contributing to open source, you'll fork someone else's repository. This workflow keeps your fork synchronized with the original project (called "upstream"), ensuring you have the latest changes before making contributions.
  </p>
  <pre class="bg-light p-3 rounded"><code># Add original repo as upstream
git remote add upstream https://github.com/original/repo.git

# Fetch from upstream
git fetch upstream

# Merge upstream changes
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main

# Push to your fork
git push origin main</code></pre>

  <h4 class="mt-5">Pro Tips and Best Practices</h4>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Commit often:</strong> Small, frequent commits are better than large, infrequent ones — they make it easier to track down bugs and understand the evolution of your code</li>
    <li><strong>Write meaningful commit messages:</strong> Your future self (and teammates) will thank you. Use present tense and be specific about what changed and why</li>
    <li><strong>Never commit secrets:</strong> API keys, passwords, tokens, and credentials don't belong in version control. Use environment variables and <code>.env</code> files (and add them to <code>.gitignore</code>!)</li>
    <li><strong>Use .gitignore:</strong> Exclude build artifacts, dependencies, IDE files, and OS files from being tracked (we cover this in detail in the advanced blog)</li>
    <li><strong>Pull before push:</strong> Always sync with remote before pushing to avoid conflicts and ensure you have the latest changes</li>
    <li><strong>Branch for everything:</strong> Never work directly on <code>main</code> — always create a feature branch, even for small changes</li>
    <li><strong>Review before commit:</strong> Use <code>git diff</code> to verify what you're committing. This catches accidental changes and debug code</li>
    <li><strong>Learn to resolve conflicts:</strong> They're inevitable in team projects. Understanding how to resolve merge conflicts is a critical skill</li>
    <li><strong>Don't force push to shared branches:</strong> <code>git push --force</code> rewrites history and can cause major issues for collaborators</li>
    <li><strong>Keep commits atomic:</strong> Each commit should represent one logical change. If you can't describe it in one sentence, it's probably too big</li>
  </ul>

  <h5 class="mt-4">Understanding Merge Conflicts</h5>
  <p>
    A <strong>merge conflict</strong> occurs when Git can't automatically merge changes because two people modified the same part of a file differently. This is normal and happens frequently in collaborative projects.
  </p>

  <p><strong>When conflicts happen:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>You and a teammate both edited the same line in a file</li>
    <li>Someone deleted a file while you modified it</li>
    <li>Multiple branches made incompatible changes to the same code</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>How to resolve conflicts:</strong></p>
  <pre class="bg-light p-3 rounded"><code># When you encounter a conflict during merge/pull:
# 1. Git marks conflicted files in your working directory
git status  # Shows which files have conflicts

# 2. Open the conflicted file(s) in your editor
# You'll see conflict markers:
# <<<<<<< HEAD
# Your changes
# =======
# Their changes
# >>>>>>> branch-name

# 3. Manually edit the file to resolve the conflict
# Remove the markers and keep the code you want

# 4. Mark as resolved and commit
git add conflicted-file.py
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflict in conflicted-file.py"</code></pre>

    <strong>Conflict resolution tip:</strong> When in doubt, communicate with your team! Sometimes the right solution requires understanding the intent behind both changes. Don't just blindly accept yours or theirs — think about what makes sense for the project.
